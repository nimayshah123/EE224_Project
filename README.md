# IITB-CPU: 16-Bit Computing System Design

## Overview

Welcome to the IITB-CPU project, a 16-bit computing system designed as the final project for the course EE 224 at IIT Bombay. This system is implemented in VHDL, serving as the Hardware Description Language (HDL) for the project.

## Project Description

The IITB-CPU is a straightforward yet powerful 16-bit computer system. It features an 8-register architecture, allowing it to process 16 bits of data at a time. The design employs VHDL as the HDL for implementation and relies on a point-to-point communication infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **16-Bit Architecture:** The IITB-CPU is designed to handle 16 bits of data in each processing cycle.
  
- **8-Register System:** With 8 registers, this computing system provides flexibility in storing and manipulating data.

- **VHDL Implementation:** VHDL serves as the primary HDL for implementing the IITB-CPU design.

- **Course Information:** This project is the culmination of the EE 224 course conducted during the 3rd semester at IIT Bombay.

## Project Components

The repository includes the following components:

1. **VHDL Files:** Contains all the necessary VHDL files for the IITB-CPU design.

2. **Testbench:** Includes the testbench files used for simulating and validating the functionality of the CPU design.

3. **Report:** The project report detailing the design principles, architecture, and simulation results.

## Getting Started

To explore and utilize the IITB-CPU project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone [repository_url]
   
2. Explore the VHDL files for the IITB-CPU design in the 'VHDL' directory.

Navigate to the 'VHDL' directory in your local repository to view and understand the VHDL implementation.

3.Review the testbench files in the 'Testbench' directory for simulation purposes.

Navigate to the 'Testbench' directory to access and analyze the testbench files used for simulating and validating the functionality of the CPU design.

4.Refer to the project report ('Report.pdf') for comprehensive insights into the design and simulation results.

Open the 'Report.pdf' file to gain detailed insights into the design principles, architecture, and simulation results of the IITB-CPU project.
